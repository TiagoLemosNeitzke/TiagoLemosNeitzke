# Welcome!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tiago Lemos Neitzke  

# Some technologies I already know:
:computer: HTML => I can create a page with semantic structure. <br />
:computer: CSS => I can apply style in page, used Less or simply CSS and create animation<br />
:computer: JavaScript => In javaScript I can create functions, DOM manipulation, event, apply style, etc. I also know how to use Jquery.<br />
:computer: PHP => I understand how to create $_SESSION, communication with database, tables, manipulation of DOM elements, etc.<br />
:computer: MySQL => I can create database, tables, using query.<br /><br/>
**Of course these are just a few things I know how to do. I keep studying and to improve my knowledge.** <br/>

# Iâ€™m currently learning technologies for developer fullstack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Vue.js..
I'm like to learn new technologies and face new challenges. I'm switching careers at the age of 35, it hasn't been easy, but I'm sure I'll make it. There are many things to learn, but every day I feel more confident in my learning.

Maybe you'll find mistakes in my English, well, I don't speak English, but I'm studying too.
