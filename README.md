# Welcome!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tiago Lemos Neitzke <br>
I am web developer. 

# Some technologies I already know:
:computer: HTML | CSS | JavaScript | PHP | MySQL 

# Some frameworks I already know:
:computer: Bootstrap | Jquery | Laravel | Less

**Of course these are just a few things I know how to do. I keep studying and to improve my knowledge.** <br/>
>*"Show me a accommodated man and I'll show you a loser".* (Thomas Edison)

# Iâ€™m currently learning technologies for developer fullstack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Vue.js..
I'm like to learn new technologies and face new challenges. I'm switching careers at the age of 35, it hasn't been easy, but I'm sure I'll make it. There are many things to learn, but every day I feel more confident in my learning.

Maybe you'll find mistakes in my English, well, I don't speak English, but I'm studying too.
