# Welcome!  ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tiago Lemos Neitzke  

# I'm Iâ€™m currently learning technologies for front end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vue.js
I'm like to learn new technologies and face new challenges. I'm switching careers at the age of 35, it hasn't been easy, but I'm sure I'll make it. There are many things to learn, but every day I feel more confident in my learning.
Feel free to see all my repositories and if possible give me ideas on how to improve.
Maybe you'll find mistakes in my English, well, I don't speak English, but I'm studying too, this has been much more difficult than learning to program. my text was ctrl-c ctrl-v in google translate.
